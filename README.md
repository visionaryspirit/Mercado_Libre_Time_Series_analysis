## Instructions

First, configure a Google Colaboratory, or Colab, workspace as follows:

1. Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), and then upload your starter notebook.

2. Run the provided code in the “Install and import the required libraries and dependencies” section. Note the following:

   * The first cell installs the necessary libraries into the Google Colab runtime.

   * The second cell imports the dependencies for use in the notebook.

With your workspace configured, you can begin the assignment. The instructions are divided into four steps and an optional fifth step as follows:

* Step 1: Find unusual patterns in hourly Google search traffic.

* Step 2: Mine the search traffic data for seasonality.

* Step 3: Relate the search traffic to stock price patterns.

* Step 4: Create a time series model by using Prophet.

* Step 5 (optional): Forecast the revenue by using time series models.
